You can sign up by completing this form: http://tinyurl.com/np4kj65\n\n> What is the Volunteer TA Program?\nThe Volunteer TA Program will give students a taster of what it's like to be a CS Department TA. Our volunteers will hold ~2 TA hours per week (alongside the Department TAs) and will be invited to attend the TA lunchtime workshops held throughout next semester.\n\n> Why apply?\nIf you missed the deadline to apply to be a TA, or just didn't want to commit to 5-7 hours a week, this program is for you! Everyone - regardless of their major - who has taken at least 1 CS course (including just 102/103) is welcome to participate, and you can sign up by completing this form: http://tinyurl.com/np4kj65 \n\n> Will I be paid?\nUnfortunately, we will not be able to pay our volunteers. We would also like to emphasize that our Volunteer TA Program has no affiliation with the CS Department TA Program. Participation as a volunteer TA will have no impact on the Department's future TA hiring decisions. This is just a way for students to gain TA experience if they would like to do so.\n\n> Where can I learn more?\nWe're working on adding a section to the website with more information, but for now you can learn more about the program here: http://tinyurl.com/q2r55kh \n\nQuestions?
